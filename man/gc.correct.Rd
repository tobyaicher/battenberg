\arguments{
\item{samplename}{Name of the sample to be used to name columns}

\item{infile.logr.baf}{String that points to the raw combined BAF and LogR file that is the result of \code{cel2baf.logr}}

\item{outfile.tumor.LogR}{The filename of the file where the tumour LogR will be written}

\item{outfile.tumor.BAF}{The filename of the file where the tumour BAF will be written}

\item{outfile.normal.LogR}{The filename of the file where the normal LogR will be written}

\item{outfile.normal.BAF}{The filename of the file where the normal BAF will be written}

\item{outfile.probeBAF}{The filename of the file where the probe ids and their BAF will be saved}

\item{snp6_reference_info_file}{String to the SNP6 reference info file that comes with Battenberg SNP6}

\item{chr_names}{A vector of chromosome names that are to be used}

\item{birdseed_report_file}{Name of the birdseed output file. This is a temp output file of one of the internally called functions of which the name cannot be defined. Don't change this parameter. (Default birdseed.report.txt)}
}
\description{
This function performs GC correction of the LogR
data. Sometimes a wave pattern is observed there
that correlates with GC content. Internally it uses
the ASCAT gc correction function.
