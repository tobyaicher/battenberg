\arguments{
\item{beaglejar}{character string path to Beagle5 java jar file}

\item{vcfpath}{character string path to the vcf input file to be phased}

\item{reffile}{character string path to the Beagle5 reference file}

\item{outpath}{character string path to Beagle's output vcf.gz file}

\item{plinkfile}{character string path to the plink file}

\item{nthreads}{integer number of threads}

\item{window}{integer max size of genomic window to be phased (cM; default 40; decrease for less memory usage; should be >1.1*overlap)}

\item{overlap}{integer overlap of windows (cM; default 4)}

\item{maxheap.gb}{integer maximum heap size for the java process in gigabytes (default 10)}
